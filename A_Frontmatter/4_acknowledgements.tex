In the biomedical sciences at least, a doctoral thesis might have a single author but almost always has a great many contributors. Mine is no exception, and so I have a number of people to thank.

First, my thanks to Dr Dario Valenzano, who welcomed me into his research group ... % TODO: Finish this
and has always been an enthusiastic, attentive and understanding supervisor.

Many past and present members of the Valenzano group have actively contributed to the projects described in these pages. Dr Patrick Smith performed the microbiota-transfer studies that were the inspiration for the project in the first place and supervised and mentored me through my first and most difficult year. Dr Rongfeng Cui performed the genome assembly that was the foundation of the work in \Cref{chap:locus} and has provided a great deal of essential advice on both experimental procedures and computational analysis. David Willemsen has also been an essential provider of advice, insight and occasionally code, particularly for the more evolutionary parts of \Cref{chap:locus}. My student supervisees, Linda Zirden, Lena Schlautmann, Pascha Hokama, and especially Davina Patel all made essential contributions to developing and testing the turquoise-killifish immunoglobulin-sequencing protocol; you were all great. Our tireless and wonderful technician, Aleksandra Placzek, has been an essential part of the \igseq project in the lab and performed several of the library preps; several of my favourite parts of this thesis would not have been possible without her. Most recently, Michael Poeschla has joined the repertoire-sequencing team and helped prepare the libraries for the final \igseq experiment in \Cref{chap:igseq}, as well as providing many ... and exciting suggestions for future extensions of the work. I am sincerely grateful to all of them for their help in making my project what it is today. My thanks also to the rest of the Valenzano lab, particularly my fellow past and present students Jens Seidel, Miriam Popkes, Daniel Davila and Dr Franzi Metge, for making ...


% TODO: Collaborators

Kathrin Reichwald provided me with essential BAC clones and a substantial amount of important advice.  

Drs John Beausang, Aleksandra Walczak, Thierry Mora and Susana Magadan helped me get started with the enormous and intimidating world of immune repertoire analysis, and Aleksandra in particular has repeatedly provided invaluable advice, introductions and insight. Jason Vander Heiden has tirelessly answered my many questions about the Immcantation pipeline and even made some changes to it on my request, while Quentin Marcou has been an invaluable help in getting to grips with his wonderful software IGoR. Many other researchers have responded to my pestering emails, given advice where I needed it, and generally been friendly, welcome and generous with their time. I am grateful to you all.

The co-ordination team of the Cologne Graduate School of Ageing Research has consistently been amazing, and I have repeatedly been impressed at the depth of their dedication, sympathy and willingness to help us students with all our big and little problems. My sincerest thanks to Dr Daniela Morick, Dr Doris Birker and Jenny Ostermann for all your help and support.

% TODO: Family

Finally, my deepest and sincerest thanks to Simon Woolf, without whom this entire long adventure would have been a great deal more difficult and a great deal less fun.

%Special thanks goes to my parents and my grandma for always believing in me, for their constant support and everything they taught me. Many thanks to Melanie M., Ariadna P., Brittany G., and Dennis S. for always listening to me and always having my back. My volleyball team for the right balance between work and exercise. My extended family, especially my family in Minnesota for their support and the possibilities they facilitated.\\
%Last but not least, I would like to thank everybody who helped me become who I am and where I am today. I am eternally grateful.
