IMGT-formatted teleost V-sequences were downloaded from IMGT as a nucleotide FASTA file. These nucleotide sequences were translated with Biopython, and the resulting amino-acid alignment was visualised using Jalview. Gap positions (with occupancy < 100%, excluding terminal gaps and CDR regions) and conserved positions (with consensus > 90%, excluding terminal gaps) were identified and recorded in TABLES.
