The turquoise killifish IgH locus resembles that of medaka, the most closely-related teleost species with a characterised \textit{IgH} locus, in several important respects, including an unusual IgM-TM splice pattern different from most teleosts and the absence of the teleost-specific antibody isotype IgZ/T. The shared absence of IgZ/T in these related species was particularly striking, as all previously-characterised teleost loci except medaka and grasscarp have been found to possess this isotype. Given their relatedness, it was hypothesised that \dots
