\label{sec:methods_pcr}

% TODO: Brief explanation of PCR and link to good summary reference.

Unless otherwise specified, all PCRs were performed using \x{2} KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix PCR Kit (see \Cref{app:solutions_enzymes}) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, for a \ul{25} reaction, \ul{12.5} KAPA ReadyMix was combined with \ul{12.5} total of template, nuclease-free water, and primers; these volumes were scaled linearly for reactions of different volumes. The mixture was then heated in a thermocycler as follows:

\subsection{Reverse-transcription}
\label{sec:methods_rt}

Reverse transcription of total RNA for Ig-seq library preparation was performed using SMARTScribe Reverse Transcriptase, a reverse-transcriptase enzyme specialised for terminal-transferase activity and template switching. % Citation needed

The reaction was performed according to the protocol specified in REFERENCE (Procedure, steps 5-9). Briefly, \ng{750} killifish total RNA was combined with \ul{2} \umol{10} gene-specific primer (GSP), along with nuclease-free water to a total volume of \ul{8}. The RNA-primer mixture was incubated for 2 minutes at \degC{70} to denature the RNA % TODO: Check this
, then cooled to \degC{42} to anneal the GSP. This annealed RNA-primer mixture was combined with \ul{12} of reverse-transcription master-mix (\Cref{tab:methods_rt_mm}), including the reverse-transcriptase enzyme and template-switch adapter (\Cref{app:oligos}, \Cref{fig:tsa}). The complete reaction mixture was incubated at for \hr{1} at \degC{42} for the reverse-transcription reaction, then mixed with \ul{1} of uracil DNA glycosylase and incubated for a further \mins{40} at \degC{37} to digest the TSA.

\subsubsection{Nucleic-acid quantitation with the Qubit 2.0} % TODO: Which exact model

The Nanodrop provides a quick and easy method of roughly quantifying nucleic-acid concentrations in a sample, as well as assessing its purity using the 260/280 and 260/230 absorption rations. However, it cannot distinguish effectively between the levels of DNA and RNA in a sample, and therefore typically gives an inflated measure of sample concentration. To obtain more accurate measurements of DNA or RNA concentration in a sample, the Qubit spectrophotometer was used. % TODO: Reference here
This machine works using a DNA- or RNA-specific dye, which flouresces at a known frequency when bound by the appropriate nucleic acid. % TODO: Specific Qubit mechanism
By quantifying the level of flourescence (?) by this dye in the sample, rather than by the nucleic acid itself, the Qubit avoids the issues associated with Nanodrop quantitation and produces a much more precise and accurate measure of nucleic-acid concentration. By comparing the flourescence level to that of standards of known concentration, the readings can be converted into measures of nucleic-acid concentration that are much more precise and accurate than those produced by the Nanodrop.

Several different Qubit kits are available, depending on the molecule to be quantified (DNA vs RNA) and its expected concentration range (High-Sensitivity vs Broad-Range).

% TODO: Add explanation of SPRI bead purification of DNA
% TODO: Read and cite protocol from Ray
% Discuss importance of PEG and effect of Tween

\subsubsection{Preparation of SeraSure magnetic bead suspension}

NB: The protocol described here produces a suspension suitable for use with DNA (or DNA:RNA heteroduplex) samples; for efficient bead cleanup of RNA samples, different buffer compositions are required.

To prepare \ml{50} of SeraSure bead suspension, the stock of SeraMag beads (\Cref{app:solutions_reagents}) was vortexed thoroughly, then \ml{1} was transferred to a new tube. This tube was then transferred to a magnetic rack and incubated at room temperature for \mins{1}, then the supernatant was removed and replaced with \ml{1} TET buffer (\Cref{app:solutions_buffers}) and the tube was removed from the rack and vortexed thoroughly. This washing process was repeated twice more, for a total of three washes in TET. A fourth cycle was used to replace the TET with incomplete SeraBind buffer (iSB, \Cref{app:solutions_buffers}). The vortexed \ml{1} aliquot of beads in iSB was then transferred to a conical tube containing \ml{28} iSB and mixed by inversion. To add the PEG, \ml{20} \pc{50} (w/v) PEG 8000 solution was dispensed slowly down the side of the conical tube, bringing the total volume to \ml{49}. Finally, this was brought to \ml{50} by adding \ul{250} \pc{10} (w/v) Tween 20 solution and \ul{750} autoclaved water to complete the SeraSure bead suspension.

% TODO: Discuss bead testing -- gels etc

\subsubsection{Bead purification of nucleic-acid samples}

The range of nucleic-acid sequence lengths retained by SPRI bead purification depends primarily on the concentration of PEG, which in turn depends on the relative volume of SeraSure bead suspension added to a sample; the higher the concentration, the shorter the minimum fragment length retained during the purification process... % TODO: Read up on and explain mechanics of size selection

To perform a bead cleanup, an aliquot of SeraBind solution was vortexed thoroughly to completely resuspend the beads, then the appropriate relative volume of SeraSure suspension was determined (based on the desired size profile of the output, see above for details) and added to a sample, mixing thoroughly by gentle pipetting. The sample was incubated at room temperature for \mins{5}, to allow the beads to bind the DNA in the sample; it was then transferred to a magnetic rack % TODO: Specify racks for different tube sizes?
and incubated for a further \mins{5} to draw as many beads as possible out of suspension. The supernatant was removed and discarded and replaced with \pc{80} ethanol, to a volume sufficient to completely submerge the bead pellet. The sample was incubated for 0.5-\mins{1}, then the ethanol was replaced and incubated for a further 0.5-\mins{1}. The second ethanol wash was removed, and the tube left on the rack until the bead pellet was almost, but not completely, dry, after which it was removed from the rack. The bead pellet was then resuspended in a suitable volume of a preferred resuspension buffer: typically nuclease-free water, TE, or EB. The resuspended sample was incubated at room temperature for at least 5 minutes to allow the nucleic-acid molecules to elute from the beads. 

% TODO: Do I ever actually use TE?

Unless otherwise specified, the beads from a cleanup were left in a sample during subsequent applications, as this avoids issues surrounding differential elution rates of different-length fragments and does not interfere with most applications. To remove beads from a sample, the sample was mixed gently but thoroughly to resuspend the beads, incubated for an extended time period (at least \mins{10}) to maximise nucleic-acid elution, then transferred to a magnetic rack and incubated for 2-\mins{5} to remove the beads from suspension. The supernatant (containing the eluted nucleic-acid molecules) was then transferred to a new tube, and the beads discarded.

\subsection{Immunoglobulin sequencing: library prep} 
The prepared reverse-transcription mixture was incubated  (\ul{5}, DETAILS) and incubated for a further \mins{40} at \degC{37} to digest residual TSA oligonucleotides. The reaction product was purified using SeraSure beads at \x{0.7} concentration, eluting in \ul{16.5} clean elution buffer. % Solutions and buffers section?

Following cleanup, the cDNA sequences were made double-stranded and amplified using nested PCR with Kapa DNA polymerase, % HotStart PCR ReadyMix?
(TABLE, PCR 1; primer details in TABLE and FIGURE), then re-purified with SeraSure beads (\x{0.7} input, resuspend in \ul{25} EB, \mins{5} elution). Partial Illumina adaptors (without indices for multiplexing) were added in a second PCR (TABLE, PCR 2; primer details in TABLE and FIGURE), followed by a further SeraSure bead cleanup (0.7x = 17.5uL input, resuspend in 15uL EB, 5 mins elution). Finally, a third PCR with Illumina TruSeq adaptor primers (...) was used to add a unique index combination to each library in a given experiment (see TABLE for index data for ...); this was followed by a further bead cleanup (...) prior to library quality control.

After the final bead cleanup, the concentration of each library was tested with the Qubit (details), while the size distribution was examined using the Agilent TapeStation 4200; this information together enabled the estimation of the concentration of the desired library band (at LENGTHS) for each sample. The samples from each experiment were pooled together according to these estimates, such that every library had the same estimated concentration in the pooled sample.
