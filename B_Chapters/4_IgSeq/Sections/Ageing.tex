\section{The effect of ageing on turquoise killifish antibody repertoires}
\label{sec:igseq_ageing}

\newabbreviation{GLM}{GLM}{Generalised linear model}

The pilot study into the antibody repertoires of mature adult turquoise killifish (\Cref{sec:igseq_pilot}) demonstrated that these repertoires are diverse and individualised, with a complex generative process giving rise to \naive sequences and an underlying clonal structure resembling that of other species. This pilot dataset, however, consisted of killifish from a single age and treatment group, and therefore gave no information as to the effect of ageing on the composition and diversity of killifish repertoires. In order to investigate the effects of ageing on the killifish antibody repertoire, a second \igseq experiment was performed using all 32 fish described in  \Cref{tab:igseq-cohorts-summary,tab:igseq-cohorts-fish}, comprising 10 fish each sacrificed at 39, 56 and 73 days post-hatching and two fish sacrificed at 128 days. Whole-body RNA samples from these fish underwent two independent library preparations as described in \Cref{sec:methods_molec_igseq} and \Cref{sec:igseq_protocol_library}, for a total of 64 pooled libraries; these were then sequenced together in two MiSeq runs, yielding a total of \embed{_Figures/txt/ageing-reads-raw-total.txt} million read pairs (\embed{_Figures/txt/ageing-reads-raw-replicate-min.txt} to \embed{_Figures/txt/ageing-reads-raw-replicate-max.txt} million pairs per replicate, \embed{_Figures/txt/ageing-reads-raw-individual-min.txt} to \embed{_Figures/txt/ageing-reads-raw-individual-max.txt} million pairs per individual), and the resulting reads underwent pre-processing, filtering and clonotyping as described in \Cref{sec:igseq_protocol_preprocess,sec:igseq_pilot_composition,sec:igseq_pilot_clones}.

\Cref{fig:igseq-ageing-read-survival-all} shows the absolute and relative read survival for each of the sixty-four sequencing libraries throughout this process. As with the pilot dataset, the replicates show relatively consistent behaviour up to and including VDJ assignment and Change-O database construction, with \embed{_Figures/txt/ageing-read-survival-init-min.txt}\,\% to \embed{_Figures/txt/ageing-read-survival-init-max.txt}\,\% of reads surviving up to this stage in the pipeline. However, a somewhat larger number of sequences (\embed{_Figures/txt/ageing-read-survival-rel-loss-total.txt}\,\%, up to \embed{_Figures/txt/ageing-read-survival-rel-loss-max.txt}\,\% per replicate) are lost during V-score filtering compared to the pilot dataset (\embed{_Figures/txt/pilot-read-survival-rel-loss-total.txt}\,\%, up to \embed{_Figures/txt/pilot-read-survival-rel-loss-max.txt}\,\% per replicate). This inconsistency is due to a greater preponderance in the ageing dataset of malformed, J-identity-lacking sequences, which in this case actually make up an absolute majority of unique sequences in the \program{pRESTO}-processed dataset (\Cref{fig:igseq-ageing-functional-prop-pre}). After filtering on V-score, however, the functional composition of the ageing dataset is similar to that of the pilot data (\Cref{fig:igseq-ageing-functional-prop-post,fig:igseq-pilot-functional-prop-b}).

Following V-score filtering, \embed{_Figures/txt/ageing-nseq-assigned-clones.txt}\,\% of remaining unique sequences in the ageing dataset were successfully assigned clonal identities. The number of clones inferred per individual ranged from \embed{_Figures/txt/ageing-nclones-individual-min.txt} to \embed{_Figures/txt/ageing-nclones-individual-max.txt}, with a median of \embed{_Figures/txt/ageing-nclones-individual-med.txt}; there is a non-significant (Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance, $p=\embed{_Figures/txt/ageing-nclones-kruskal-p.txt}$) decline in number of clones per individual with age (\Cref{fig:igseq-ageing-nclones}). These clonal counts are much lower than the median of \embed{_Figures/txt/pilot-nclones-individual-med.txt} clones per individual for the pilot study, reflecting the lower number of reads per individual available in this dataset; for comparison, for the four individuals included in the pilot study, the number of identified clones in the ageing dataset ranges from \embed{_Figures/txt/ageing-nclones-individual-min-pilot.txt} to \embed{_Figures/txt/ageing-nclones-individual-max-pilot.txt}. Concordantly, the distribution of clone sizes detected in the ageing dataset is even more skewed towards small clones than in the pilot dataset: \embed{_Figures/txt/ageing-nclones-pc-1count.txt}\,\% of clones are observed as just a single unique sequence across all replicates, while \embed{_Figures/txt/ageing-nclones-pc-small.txt}\,\% contain fewer than five unique sequences (\Cref{fig:igseq-ageing-clone-sizes-sizes}). As in the pilot dataset, larger clones were much more likely to be observed across both replicates for a given individual  (\Cref{fig:igseq-ageing-clone-sizes-reps}).

\end{figure}

In order to assess the effect of age on the clonal diversity of killifish antibody repertoires, the alpha-diversity spectrum of each age group (\Cref{app:diversity}) was computed as described in \Cref{sec:methods_comp_igdownstream_spectra,sec:igseq_pilot_clones}. The resulting spectra, shown in \Cref{fig:igseq-ageing-clone-diversity-alpha}, indicate that repertoire diversity declines monotonically between 5.5 and 10.5 weeks of age in the turquoise killifish, with the most rapid decline observed between 8 and 10.5 weeks: across the entire spectrum, the alpha-diversity of the 8-week group is the same as or lower than that of the 5.5 week group, the 10.5-week group is markedly less diverse than the 8-week group, and the 18-week and 10.5-week groups exhibit similar diversity. These observations suggest a model in which repertoire diversity begins declining before or at reproductive maturation (c. 5 weeks post-hatching), declines rapidly in later adulthood, and reaches a plateau of low diversity late in life; however, the smaller size of the 18-week-old group in comparison to the others means that the patterns observed in this group cannot be taken with confidence, and it is possible that a further decline after 10.5 weeks would be observed in a larger sample.

In order to test the significance of these differences in clonal diversity between age groups, the Hill-diversity measurements from each individual spectrum (\Cref{fig:igseq-ageing-clone-diversity-solo-spectra}) were compared across age groups at each of six diversity orders (0, 1, 1.5, 2, 3 and 4) using two distinct methods. In the first, a generalised linear model (GLM) of diversity \textit{versus} age-at-death was fitted to each diversity order under a gamma distribution, and the resulting model was compared to a null (intercept-only) model to test for a significant ageing term; in the second, a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance was used, again to test for a significant effect of age-at-death on the distribution of Hill diversities at a given diversity order. Both results gave roughly consistent results (\Cref{fig:igseq-ageing-clone-diversity-solo-fit-gamma}), as did GLM-based methods assuming a linear or inverse-Gaussian distribution (\Cref{fig:igseq-ageing-clone-diversity-solo-fit-linear,fig:igseq-ageing-clone-diversity-solo-fit-igauss}): in all cases, a significant effect of age on diversity is found for all tested diversity orders above 1, but not for order 0 or 1 (\Cref{app:diversity}). This pattern, which indicates a significant age effect at higher but not lower diversity orders, suggests that such an effect is driven more by expansion of large clones (which primarily affects higher-order diversity measures) than a decrease in the number of smaller clones (which primarily affects lower-order measures like species richness), a result consistent with the the results in \Cref{fig:igseq-ageing-nclones}; if this is the case, it would accord with earlier findings of persistent clonal expansions of activated cells in aged B-cell repertoires in other model systems (\Cref{sec:intro_immunosenescence}).

\label{fig:igseq-ageing-clone-diversity-solo-fit-gamma}
\end{figure}

While a significant decline in clonal diversity was age was found at various diversity orders, no such decline was observed in the VJ-repertoires of the different age-groups, either when visually comparing the alpha-spectra (\Cref{fig:igseq-ageing-VJ-diversity-alpha}) or statistically comparing the distributions at different diversity orders (\Cref{fig:igseq-ageing-VJ-diversity-solo-fit-gamma}). This marked difference between the clonal and VJ repertoires is at first surprising, as a distortion in the clonal repertoire caused by an increased dominance of a few large clones might be expected to cause a similar distortion in the VJ repertoire by expanding those dominant clones' V/J combinations; however, given that an average of \embed{_Figures/txt/ageing-pc-seq-in-small-clones-avg.txt}\,\% of unique sequences in the repertoire are contained in small clones of fewer than 5 unique sequences (\Cref{fig:igseq-ageing-pc-seq-in-small-clones}), and that this average does not change significantly with age (Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance, $p=\embed{_Figures/txt/ageing-pc-seq-in-small-clones-kruskal-p.txt}$), it may simply be the case that any age-related change in VJ-diversity arising from the minority of sequences in expanded clones is dominated by an absence of change in the V/J-usage distribution of \naive B-cells. % TODO: To test this hypothesis...

While the alpha-diversity of the VJ-repertoire (reflecting average diversity within each individual repertoire) does not appear to change with age in the turquoise killifish, the beta-diversity (reflecting inter-individual variability in VJ-expression) shows dramatic differences between age groups, especially at higher diversity orders (\Cref{fig:igseq-ageing-VJ-diversity-beta}): while the diversity of the 5.5- and 8-week-old groups is close to the theoretical minimum for that sample size, the 10.5-week-old group exhibits a substantial increase in inter-individual variability across a wide range of diversity orders, and the 18-week old group shows an even more dramatic increase. This increase in inter-individual diversity with age is corroborated by inter-individual RDI distances computed on VJ-repertoires within each age group: both the overall distribution of inter-individual distances (\Cref{fig:igseq-ageing-rdi-VJ-individual-groupdist-all}), and the distribution of nearest-neighbour distances within each age group (\Cref{fig:igseq-ageing-rdi-VJ-individual-groupdist-nn}), increase significantly with age. This tendency for individuals from increasing age groups to become more distinct in their VJ-repertoires can also be observed using principal co-ordinate analysis:  in \Cref{fig:igseq-ageing-rdi-VJ-individual-pcoa-facet}, the great majority of individuals from younger age groups are visibly more tightly clustered than those from older age groups, which drift apart progressively as age-at-death increases. As in ageing humans (\Cref{sec:intro_immunosenescence}), therefore, the ageing killifish appears to become more individualised and distinct in its antibody repertoire, presumably as the result of an accumulating history of unique individual responses to antigen exposure.
