	abstract = {Immunoglobulins (Igs) or antibodies (Abs) are the principal operators of the adaptive humoral immune response. For optimum functional activity they acquire an optimized structure for antigen (Ag) recognition, precipitation, agglutination, phagocytosis (IgG1/3 and IgA), cytotoxicity (IgG1/3), transport through mucosa (IgA and IgM) and placenta (IgG1/3), complement activation (IgG1/3 and IgM) and release of inflammatory mediators (IgE). A diversity with potentially up to 1015 different Ab specificities is generated during Ag-independent B cell development in the bone marrow by combinatorial V-D-J joining, creation of junctional diversity, and combinatorial association of L and H chains. Furthermore,Ab variety is created during Ag-dependent B cell maturation in peripheral lymphatic tissues by isotype class switching and somatic hypermutation. Two types of enzymes play a key role in Ab diverseness, i. e., the products of recombination-activating genes RAG1 and RAG2 and the affinity induced deaminase (AID). The prevailing adult-type B2 cells provide the basis for the acquired humoral immune response characterized by Ab production,Ag processing and presentation, immunological memory and tolerance along with the generation of the anti-idiotype network,whereas the fetal-type B1 cells may play a role in innate immunity and autoimmunity. Impairment of B cell immunity includes immunodeficiency (agammaglobulinemia), malignant transformation (leukemia, lymphoma, plasmocytoma) and immune dysregulation (allergy, autoimmunity). The diagnostic relevance of Abs comprises classical serology (immunoprecipitation, agglutination, complement binding, RIA, ELISA), immunocytochemistry and immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence (microscopic and flow cytometric), cytotoxicity tests, immunoblots, immunospot assays and immunoabsorption (affinity chromatography). Therapeutic application of Abs (passive immunization) is directed against infections, intoxications, solid tumors, leukemias and lymphomas, graft rejection and graft-versus-host reaction, hemolytic anemia, and autoimmune diseases. The generation of genetically engineered monoclonal Abs (mAbs) has revolutionized the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of Abs in almost all disciplines of modern medicine.},

	abstract = {The disparate diversity in immunoglobulin (Ig) repertoire has been a subject of fascination since the emergence of prototypic adaptive immune system in vertebrates. The carboxy terminus region of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) has been well established in tetrapod lineage and is crucial for its function in class switch recombination (CSR) event of Ig diversification. The absence of CSR in the paraphyletic group of fish is probably due to changes in catalytic domain of AID and lack of cis-elements in IgH locus. Therefore, understanding the arrangement of Ig genes in IgH locus and functional facets of fish AID opens up new realms of unravelling the alternative mechanisms of isotype switching and antibody diversity. Further, the teleost AID has been recently reported to have potential of catalyzing CSR in mammalian B cells by complementing AID deficiency in them. In that context, the present review focuses on the recent advances regarding the generation of diversity in Ig repertoire in the absence of AID-regulated class switching in teleosts and the possible role of T cell-independent pathway involving B cell activating factor and a proliferation-inducing ligand in activation of CSR machinery.},

	abstract = {Immunoglobulin (Ig), which exists only in jawed vertebrates, is one of the most important molecules in adaptive immunity. In the last two decades, many teleost Ig genes have been identified by in silico data mining from the enormous gene and EST databases of many fish species. In this review, the organization of Ig gene segments, the expressed Ig isotypes and their transcriptional controls are discussed. The Ig heavy chain (IgH) locus in teleosts encodes the variable (V), the diversity (D), the joining (J) segments and three different isotypic constant (C) regions including Cμ, Cδ, and Cζ/τ genes, and is organized as a “translocon” type like the IgH loci of higher vertebrates. In contrast, the Ig light (L) chain locus is arranged in a “multicluster” or repeating set of VL, JL, and CL segments. The IgL chains have four isotypes; two κ L1/G and L3/F), σ (L2) and λ. The transcription of IgH genes in teleosts is regulated by a VH promoter and the Eμ3′ enhancer, which both function in a B cell-specific manner. The location of the IgH locus, structure and transcriptional function of the Eμ3′ enhancer are important to our understanding of the evolutional changes that have occurred in the IgH gene locus.},
