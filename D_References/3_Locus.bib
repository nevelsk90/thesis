	abstract = {Background
Repetitive elements make up significant proportions of genomes. However, their roles in evolution remain largely unknown. To provide insights into the roles of repetitive elements in fish genomes, we conducted a comparative analysis of repetitive elements of 52 fish species in 22 orders in relation to their living aquatic environments.

Results
The proportions of repetitive elements in various genomes were found to be positively correlated with genome sizes, with a few exceptions. More importantly, there appeared to be specific enrichment between some repetitive element categories with species habitat. Specifically, class II transposons appear to be more abundant in freshwater bony fish than in marine bony fish when phylogenetic relationship is not considered. In contrast, marine bony fish harbor more tandem repeats than freshwater species. In addition, class I transposons appear to be more abundant in primitive species such as cartilaginous fish and lamprey than in bony fish.

Conclusions
The enriched association of specific categories of repetitive elements with fish habitats suggests the importance of repetitive elements in genome evolution and their potential roles in fish adaptation to their living environments. However, due to the restriction of the limited sequenced species, further analysis needs to be done to alleviate the phylogenetic biases.

Although their immune system is based on the fundamental receptors, pathways, and cell types found in all groups of vertebrates, fishes show a diversity of particular features that challenge some classical concepts of immunology. In this chapter, we discuss the particularities of fish immune repertoires from a comparative perspective. We examine how allelic exclusion can be achieved when multiple Ig loci are present, how isotypic diversity and functional specificity impact clonal complexity, how loss of the MHC class II molecules affects the cooperation between T and B cells, and how deep sequencing technologies bring new insights about somatic hypermutation in the absence of germinal centers. The unique coexistence of two distinct B-cell lineages respectively specialized in systemic and mucosal responses is also discussed. Finally, we try to show that the diverse adaptations of immune repertoires in teleosts can help in understanding how somatic adaptive mechanisms of immunity evolved in parallel in different lineages across vertebrates.},

	abstract = {The disparate diversity in immunoglobulin (Ig) repertoire has been a subject of fascination since the emergence of prototypic adaptive immune system in vertebrates. The carboxy terminus region of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) has been well established in tetrapod lineage and is crucial for its function in class switch recombination (CSR) event of Ig diversification. The absence of CSR in the paraphyletic group of fish is probably due to changes in catalytic domain of AID and lack of cis-elements in IgH locus. Therefore, understanding the arrangement of Ig genes in IgH locus and functional facets of fish AID opens up new realms of unravelling the alternative mechanisms of isotype switching and antibody diversity. Further, the teleost AID has been recently reported to have potential of catalyzing CSR in mammalian B cells by complementing AID deficiency in them. In that context, the present review focuses on the recent advances regarding the generation of diversity in Ig repertoire in the absence of AID-regulated class switching in teleosts and the possible role of T cell-independent pathway involving B cell activating factor and a proliferation-inducing ligand in activation of CSR machinery.},

Such controls are mediated at the level of gene segment accessibility to V(D)J recombinase activity.

	abstract = {Summary
Aging is a complex process that affects multiple organs. Modeling aging and age-related diseases in the lab is challenging because classical vertebrate models have relatively long lifespans. Here, we develop the first platform for rapid exploration of age-dependent traits and diseases in vertebrates, using the naturally short-lived African turquoise killifish. We provide an integrative genomic and genome-editing toolkit in this organism using our de-novo-assembled genome and the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. We mutate many genes encompassing the hallmarks of aging, and for a subset, we produce stable lines within 2–3 months. As a proof of principle, we show that fish deficient for the protein subunit of telomerase exhibit the fastest onset of telomere-related pathologies among vertebrates. We further demonstrate the feasibility of creating specific genetic variants. This genome-to-phenotype platform represents a unique resource for studying vertebrate aging and disease in a high-throughput manner and for investigating candidates arising from human genome-wide studies.

	abstract = {African annual fishes from the genus Nothobranchius are small teleosts that inhabit temporary water bodies subject to annual desiccation due to the alternation of the monsoon seasons. Given their unique biology, these fish have emerged as a model taxon in several biological disciplines. Their increasing popularity stems from the extremely short lifespan that is the result of their specific life-history adaptations and is retained under laboratory conditions. Nothobranchius furzeri, the most popular laboratory species, is the vertebrate species with the shortest lifespan recorded in captivity. In the laboratory, adults of different Nothobranchius species and populations live between 3 and 18 months and, notably, there is a negative correlation between the captive lifespan of a species and the aridity of their habitat. Their short lifespan is coupled to rapid age-dependent functional decline and expression of cellular and molecular changes comparable to those observed in other vertebrates, including humans. The recent development of transgenesis in this species makes it possible to insert specific constructs into their genome, and the establishment of transgenic lines is facilitated by their very rapid generation time, which can be as short as 1 month. This makes Nothobranchius species particularly suited for investigating biological and molecular aspects of ageing and ageing-associated dysfunctions. At the same time, they also represent a unique model taxon to investigate the evolution of life-history adaptations and their genetic architecture. We review their natural history, including phylogenetic relationships, distribution in relation to habitat conditions and natural selection for differential longevity, population structure and demography, and life cycle with emphasis on diapause that may occur at three stages during embryonic development. We further critically evaluate their use as a laboratory model for understanding the evolution of a rapid ageing rate and its consequences for other life-history traits, for cellular, molecular and integrative traits associated with the ageing process, high incidence of neoplasias, their utility for genome-wide gene-expression studies, and as a model for quantitative genetics. We summarize recent achievements in fostering Nothobranchius species as a widely applicable model system, including an annotated transcriptome, successful transgenesis, and existence of viable inbred lines. We compare the conditions they experience in the wild and in captivity and suggest that they are an ideal taxon to investigate natural genetic variation in a laboratory setting. We conclude that Nothobranchius species – and N. furzeri in particular – could become a unique model taxon that bridges interests in ecological and biomedical research. We hope that a conceptual and methodological integration of these two branches of biology will provide important new insights.},
