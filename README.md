This repository contains all the scripts, TeX files and other resources required to 
compile my PhD thesis from processed data, including *de novo* generation of most
figures and tables. To do this, you'll need to [install Conda][] and [Snakemake][]. Then run:

> snakemake --use-conda compile_thesis

[install Conda]: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html
[Snakemake]: https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html

Raw data and processing scripts are in the process of being made available; I'll update this
repository with links once the relevant papers are published.
